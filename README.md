# Unraveling-User-Behavior-in-Telecommunication-Services

This project focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning models designed to predict user behavior, specifically whether a user has subscribed to the premium 'ultra' plan. Using a diverse set of features such as call records, minutes of usage, messages sent, and data consumption, the models will be trained on historical data. The training process will include fine-tuning through hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance.

The dataset comprises user-related information, with each record containing details like call activity, message counts, data usage, and the user's subscription status (standard or 'ultra'). Leveraging this data, the goal is to build models that can effectively discern patterns indicative of premium plan subscriptions.

The machine learning models will undergo rigorous evaluation to ensure their robustness in making accurate predictions. The evaluation metrics will include measures like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The models will be refined iteratively based on the evaluation results.
